I'm an AI & Full-Stack Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Welcome to my GitHub!

📖 About Me

🌱 I'm currently a dual-degree undergraduate student pursuing:

A B.E. in Instrumentation & Electronics from Jadavpur University (CGPA: 7.8/10).

A B.Sc. in Data Science from IIT Madras (CGPA: 8.46/10).

💡 I'm passionate about the entire AI pipeline, from model development (PyTorch, CV, GenAI) to building robust, full-stack applications (Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL).

🔭 I'm currently an AI/ML Intern at SETV Global, where I'm developing and deploying CNNs, YOLO, and 3D CNNs for medical imaging tasks like MRI analysis.
